Description: The open sourced data management software 'Integrated
    Rule-Oriented Data System' ('iRODS') offers solutions for the whole
    data life cycle (<https://irods.org/>). The loosely constructed and
    highly configurable architecture of 'iRODS' frees the user from strict
    formatting constraints and single-vendor solutions. This package
    provides an interface to the 'iRODS' HTTP API, allowing you to manage
    your data and metadata in 'iRODS' with R. Storage of annotated files
    and R objects in 'iRODS' ensures findability, accessibility,
    interoperability, and reusability of data.
