Description: The open sourced data management software 'Integrated Rule-Oriented 
    Data System' (iRODS) offers solutions for the whole data life cycle 
    (<https://irods.org/>). The loosely constructed and highly configurable 
    architecture of 'iRODS' frees the user from strict formatting constraints 
    and single-vendor solutions. This package provides an interface to the 
    'iRODS' REST API, allowing you to manage your data and metadata in 'iRODS' 
    with R. Storage of annotated files and R objects in 'iRODS' ensures 
    findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of data.
